In this assignment, you will explore the standard C command-line tool,
`getopt`.

a. Read the man page for `getopt` and for `getopt_long`.

b. Write a simple C program that takes advantage of one or both
to do some basic command-line processing.  At minimum, you should
suport `-h` or `--help` flags, input file names, and an output
file.  Other than that, you can make the program do whatever you
want.

c. Add your program to the `command-line` folder of the 
[primary CSC282 repository](https://github.com/grinnell-cs/csc282-2022sp).
